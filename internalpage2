                	<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>Hello, my name is Yeji Kim and I was born in South Korea, but lived most of my life in
					New Jersey. I am currently a Sophomore at <a id="link" href="https://www.bu.edu">Boston University</a> 
					studying graphic design and art education.</p>

					<p>I love all Studio Ghibli films, but my favorite film amongst them all is My Neighbor Totoro
					directed by Hayao Miyazaki. This film is my favorite film, because it successfully portrays 
					children's innocence and imagination. This film is a very heart-warming and nostalgic film for me 
					also because I grew up watching this film as a child. I also really love the style of drawing 
					and the color scheme this film has. On top of the drawing style of this film, I really love the
					soundtrack Studio Ghibli has.</p>
					
					<div class="story1">
					<h2>My Neighbor Totoro</h2>
					<h3>Plot</h3>
					<p> In 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, Satsuki 
					and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively), move into an old house 
					closer to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term 
					illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called susuwatari, 
					which can be seen when moving from bright to dark places.[note 1] When the girls become 
					comfortable in their new house, the susuwatari leave to find another empty house. One day, 
					Mei discovers two small spirits who lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. 
					She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars that she 
					interprets as "Totoro". Mei thinks Totoro is the Troll from her illustrated book Three 
					Billy Goats Gruff, with her mispronouncing Troll. She falls asleep atop Totoro, but when 
					Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family 
					Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her by telling her that Totoro will reveal himself when he 
					wants to.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="story2">
					<p>One rainy night, the girls are waiting for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls 
					asleep on Satsuki's back, and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him 
					for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, 
					so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken for her father. Delighted, he gives her 
					a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A giant, bus-shaped cat halts at the stop, and 
					Totoro boards it and leaves. Shortly after, Tatsuo's bus arrives. A few days after 
					planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his colleagues 
					engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds and join in, causing the seeds 
					to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. 
					In the morning, the tree is gone, but the seeds have sprouted.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="story3">
					<p>The girls discover that a planned visit by Yasuko has to be postponed because of a 
					setback in her treatment. Mei does not take this well and argues with Satsuki, leaving 
					for the hospital to bring fresh corn to Yasuko. Her disappearance prompts Satsuki and 
					the neighbors to search for her. In desperation, Satsuki returns to the camphor tree 
					and pleads for Totoro's help. He delightfully summons the Catbus, which carries her to 
					where the lost Mei sits, and the sisters emotionally reunite. The bus then takes them 
					to the hospital. The girls overhear a conversation between their parents and learn that 
					she has been kept in hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise doing well. They secretly 
					leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it, and return home. 
					Eventually, Yasuko returns home, and the sisters play with other children while Totoro and 
					his friends watch them from afar.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="story4">
					<h3>Themes</h3>
					<p>Animism is a large theme in this film according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck. Totoro has 
					animistic traits and has kami status due to the fact that he lives in a camphor tree in a 
					Shinto shrine surrounded by a Shinto rope and was referred to as "mori no nushi," or 
					"master of the forest". Moreover, Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her 
					encounter with Totoro her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank 
					Totoro. This is a common practice in the Shinto tradition following an encounter with a 
					kami. The themes of the film was additionally noted for Phillip E. Wegner, who believed 
					the film as being an example of alternative history citing the utopian-like setting of the 
					anime.</p>
